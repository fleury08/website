          <p>Let me quickly introduce myself. I was born in 1989 and started exploring PCs at the age of 4. My first encounters were with the Commodore 64 and a 286 PC. After elementary school, I attended high school for four years and then university for three years, both specializing in networking. I am currently developing for a private company but am also working on my own projects.
