						<p>Let me quickly introduce myself. Born in 1989, I started 'working' with pc since I was a little boy.
							My first encounter was Commodore 64 and Amiga (about '93) and then straight to PCs (starting by 286).
							4 Years of High School, 3 years of University (both specialized on networking) and endless hours of staying up late.
							Currently developing for private company but trying to do my own stuff.
